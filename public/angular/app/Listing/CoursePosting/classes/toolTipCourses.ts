For e.g. – Let’s say there is a university U1 which has a faculty F1. The faculty F1 has a department D1 which offers a course C1. Let’s also assume that we have a listing for U1 and F1 (and not for D1). In this case, course C1 will have F1 as a primary parent.<br/>Primary parent will primarily define the tuple on which this course will be shown. ",
        institute_hierarchy: "This option is provided to show users other prospective listings under the main listings selected, where the course may be mapped. This is to avoid mistakes. For e.g. Let’s say there is a university U1 which has a faculty F1. The faculty F1 has a department D1 which offers a course C1.<br/>Now, while adding the course C1, if F1 is set as parent, this layer will be thrown which will show other prospective institute listings within F1 (which is D1), and hence user can select D1 as the parent. ",
        course_variant: "This field shows whether a student will get a single or double credentials (degree, diplomas or certificate) out of the course. So, all the dual degrees/diploma/certificate program, integrated courses, etc. will be part of this.<br/><br/>In case, a course doesn’t provide any degree, diploma or a certificate, “none” course variant will be selected. For e.g. – self-learning courses, where students do not even get a certificate, most of the coaching classes.<br/><br/>Note – Use this field only when the student gets 2 degrees/diplomas/certificates. Exception – Integrated courses. ",
        hierarchy: "With the new course listings CMS, you need not select all the 3 dropdowns to attach a stream hierarchy to a course. You can attach a stream alone.<br/>The hierarchies mapped here, should be the hierarchy where the course is actually relevant. For e.g. – a “B.Tech in Civil Engineering” should be mapped to only Civil engineering as a specialization (under Engineering stream), it should not be mapped to any other specialization like Mechanical or Computer Science.<br/><br/>Note 1 – The top level hierarchies don’t need to be mapped separately. For e.g. – let’s say a course is mapped to Hospitality->Hotel Management (Stream->Sub-Stream) hierarchy, we don’t have to map it to “Hospitality” (Stream) separately. It will be automatically taken care of.<br/><br/>Note 2 – In case you feel that a certain hierarchy (sub-stream/specialization) is not available, do not map it to any random hierarchy. Please get in touch with the product team to resolve such issues.<br/><br/>Primary Hierarchy – is primarily used for URL creation and SEO purposes. ",
        entry_course: "In case of “double” course variant, where a student gets 2 degrees/diplomas/certificate, use the Entry/First course for filling details of the course with a lower level.<br/><br/>For e.g. – for a B.Tech + M.Tech dual degree course, details of B.Tech program will be filled in the Entry/First course and M.Tech in the Exit/Second course.<br/><br/>In case both have a same level, e.g. – M.Tech + MS, the course which is taught first should be entered here.
