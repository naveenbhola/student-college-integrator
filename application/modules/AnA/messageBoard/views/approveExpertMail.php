Dear <?php echo $name; ?>,<br/>
<p>Congratulations! We are glad to confirm that your application for becoming an expert on Shiksha has been approved by the moderation team. We look forward to your quality contribution that will help students make an informed career decision.</p>
<p>To maximize your quality contributions on Shiksha Caf&#233;, your answers should be:</p>
<p><b>Clear and precise:</b> Please provide easy to understand information. To help the community understand and use your suggestion, use grammatically correct, simple and clear language.</p>
<p><b>Factually correct:</b> Do a little research before answering a question. Please ensure that the information you provide is factually correct. If possible and if applicable, cite the source of your information whenever you can.</p>
<p><b>Detailed:</b> Try  to provide a detailed and complete answer by addressing all parts of the question. It means that giving one word or one line answer is not enough. It also means that adding irrelevant or unrelated information might make an answer long, but it'll not make it <u>complete</u>.</p>
<p>Giving good answers has its rewards that will be reflected as a quick increase in your prominence and influence in the community. On the other hand, giving poorly written, uninformative answers is strongly frowned upon by the community.</p>
<p>Here's what all you should <b><u>not</u></b> include in your answers:</p>
<p><b>Marketing:</b> Shiksha caf&#233; is not a place to market your goods or services. This practice is against the community guidelines. The community may take very strong action, which may include permanent suspension of the user account if an expert is found marketing on Shiksha.</p>
<p><b>Irrelevant answers:</b> Students visit Shiksha caf&#233; to seek guidance from seniors like you. If your answers are off-track, unrelated to the question, or generally irrelevant then the community will invariably rate your answers as poor and this will have a negative impact on your other contributions.</p>
<p><b>Duplicate answers:</b> Do not copy paste answers from internet. Do not copy paste same answer to multiple questions. Students come to Shiksha to seek answers when they can't find satisfactory answer anywhere on the internet. Copy pasting the information will not help them in any way.</p>
</p>We look forward to your continued contribution of quality answers. In case, you have any doubt or query regarding the community guidelines, please feel free to get in touch with <u><font color='blue'>aneeket.barua@shiksha.com</font></u> or <u><font color='blue'>neha.jha@shiksha.com</font></u></p>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
Team Shiksha
