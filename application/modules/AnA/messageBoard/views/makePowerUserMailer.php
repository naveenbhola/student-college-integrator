Dear <?php echo $NameOfUser;?>,
<p>Congratulations! In view of your excellent contribution to the community, the Shiksha Caf&#233;</br/>
moderators have chosen you to be a Power User. Power Users are a small group selected</br/>
community members who are assigned special privileges. Following are some tasks that you</br/>
could do being a power user:</p>
<p><u>Link related questions:</u>Ever felt you have answered a question previously? Now you can</br/>
manually link any new question with a similar question that you have>answered before. You</br/>
will now see a new link titled "Link questions" on question detail page. Clicking on this link</br/>
will enable you to quickly search through your previously answered questions and link the </br/>
current question with them.</p>
<p><u>Link and merge discussions:</u> You can now link and merge a new discussion topic that you</br/>
feel is a duplicate copy of an already existing discussion. Once your request is approved by</br/>
the moderator, the discussion will be closed for new comments and will instead redirect all</br/>
the users to the older discussion topic.</p>
<p>We will soon be adding similar privileges for power users like you. We trust you will use</br/>
these features in making Shiksha Caf&#233; a better and useful community for students and</br/>
knowledge seekers. We once again thank you for your valuable contributions and look</br/>
forward to your continued support.</p>

<p>Thanks,<br />Shiksha Team</p>
