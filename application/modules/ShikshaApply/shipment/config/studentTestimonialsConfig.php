		'description' => "I availed Shiksha DHL Express service for sending my MS Comp Science application packages to universities in USA for Fall 2017. This service was very useful since as a Shiksha student, i received 40% discount over normal DHL courier price.  I had applied to 7 colleges, namely - South Dakota University, Eastern Michigan University, CSU Northridge, CSU Fresno, CSU San Bernardino, North West Missouri State University, College Of Staten Island-CUNY all located at USA . Without Shiksha DHL express, i would have spent approx RS 1300  per courier package . But with Shiksha DHL express, per package courier cost was only Rs. 875/-. I would like to acknowledge and extend my heartfelt gratitude to my Counsellor at Shiksha, who guided me through the entire Shiksha DHL Express service."

		'description' => "Great service by Shiksha and DHL made the work far more easier and convenient with the home pick up service and express delivery. The discount given through Shiksha was brilliant and the cheapest compared to any other courier services. The pick was done and the estimated time allotted without any complaints. The tracking system was great I knew where my parcel was at each stage of delivery. Great initiative taken by Shiksha to help the student."
