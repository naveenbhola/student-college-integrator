facultyDescription: "The faculty in our college is another reason why students seek to study in the premier institutes. Such premier institutes are expected to host the best possible group of faculty for teaching. IIMB does a decent job at that. Although all the faculty members possess varied academic distinctions (having a range of academic publications, prior academic experience in other reputed institutes) or rich industry knowledge (having worked in an organisation or sector for good part of their lives) or both, only some are able to translate that to rich learning engagements for students in the class. At least, that has been my experience so far. One could assume a normal distribution in quality of professors where the small portion (~20%) are excellent, most of them (~60%) are average, and the remaining are not much good at their lectureship.",

Be it in the academic space like labs, classrooms, library, etc., personal space like sports and fitness facilities, recreational facilities, etc., or related space like Wi-Fi, canteen and cafeteria food, medical facilities, etc., one gets access to the top-notch quality of systemic infrastructure. The high fees charged per student could be attributed as one of the primary factors contributing to such availing.",

The lateral and final placements for PGP class of 2016-18 saw 420 students receiving offers from 140+ companies, in India and abroad, across sectors. Similar was the case for summer placements of PGP 2017-19 batch, which I was a part of. Though I don't have ascertained information on absolute highest and lowest placement figures, the average has been consistently pegging at 20 LPA-22 LPA for the last couple of years. The offers were provided by domains such as consulting, marketing, banks and finance sector, general management, product management, supply chain management, human resource management etc. Top-tier firms from all of the aforementioned sectors participate in the placement process. The efficient placement cell of the institute makes sure of that.",

reviewDescription: "IIM-B has a beautiful, lush green and eco-diverse campus. Being situated at Bangalore is another pro, climate and lifestyle-wise. The fests, though decent, are not as big as some of the engineering fests that one might have experienced earlier. The campus life is good, both academic and non-academic wise. Since the duration of the programme is short, the overall schedule is much more condensed and compact compared to an undergraduate programme.",
