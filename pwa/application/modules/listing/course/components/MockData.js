	facultyDescription: "Faculty is probably the best aspect of IIM A. They are well qualified and extremely knowledgeable. The fields of faculty members varies across Marketing, Finance, Public Policy, Economics, Information Systems. The teaching is completely case based and focuses on application of learned concepts. The scope of industry exposure is through internships or if someone wants to try their hands on a live project, there is a student body dedicated to pitching projects to be taken up by groups of students. Also, the incubation centre of IIM A is amongst the best in the country, if someone is interested in entrepreneurship. Course curriculum of first year was very helpful in learning the basics of management. The second year is fully customizable and all courses are chosen by students based on their interest. IIM A does't offer any specialisation whatsoever, so there is focus on learning for the sake of learning. ",

IIM A has cluster system &#40;with companies of same field arriving on same day&#41;, almost 40% of batch I guess had offers by the end of cluster 1 (I. e. Consulting & Finance firms), including PPOs and lateral offers. 100% of students got placed. The highest, the lowest and Average can't be calculated since a number of companies don't give salary details in the Job Description Forms. But the highest for domestic would definitely be more than or equal to 50 LPA. Around 100+ firms participated across Consulting, Finance, Marketing, General Management, Technology, and BFSI profiles. Consulting took maximum students, my guess would be ~ 100. 100% of students got internships as it is a mandatory requirement. Stipend details are not shared by companies, but the highest domestic will ~ 3.5 lacs. Yes, there is a placement cell. It is responsible for ensuring internships and placements for all interested students. It is a complete student run body. ",

However, inevitably, the entire batch gets placed every time within 3 days.

The institute leads in both national and international placements. In the two years that I have spent here (even before), the institute has never failed to achieve 100 percent placements for internships as well as final placements. The cluster process of the placement program gives the right opportunity to the students to choose the sector they want to join. Companies from sectors like investment banking, FMCG, consulting, BFSI, infrastructure, pharma etc. come for the recruitment. IIMA follows IPRS reporting standards for placements, which gives comprehensive details about the visiting companies and the stipend offered. The rest of the information is made publicly available through this process. ",

Faculty is so amazing as they have mastered their respective subjects, have worked in big companies and MNC’s and so are able to tell us what actually we are going to do after MBA. The infrastructure is good. It only lacks of bigger washrooms but trust me everything else is just perfect. We have radio station, a big pool of books, computer labs, canteens, swimming pool, playground, etc.",
